# How to Change the Remote URL of a Git Repository

If you've set the wrong remote URL for your Git repository or need to update it for any reason, follow these steps:


## 1. Check the Current Remote URL
Open your terminal/command prompt and navigate to your repository folder:
			git remote -v
This will display the current remote URLs for `origin` (and any other remotes).


## 2. Change the Remote URL
To change the `origin` remote to a new URL, use the following command:
			git remote set-url origin NEW_URL
Replace `NEW_URL` with the correct GitHub repository URL.  
Example : git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepo.git


## 3. Verify the Change
Check that the remote URL has been updated:
			git remote -v
You should now see the new URL listed.


## 4. (Optional) Remove and Re-add the Remote
If you prefer, you can remove the existing remote and add a new one:
			git remote remove origin
			git remote add origin https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepo.git



## 5. Push to the New Remote
Once the remote URL is set, you can push your changes as usual:
			git push -u origin branch-name
Replace `branch-name` with your current branch (e.g., `main` or `master`).


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Notes

- Make sure you have permissions to push to the new remote URL.
- If you use SSH instead of HTTPS, replace the URL accordingly.

---

**Troubleshooting:**
- If you get authentication errors, check your GitHub credentials or access token.
- If the repository does not exist at the new URL, create it on GitHub first.
